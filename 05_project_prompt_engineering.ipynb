Although voting is typically involved in electing officials, the finer elements of a republic can vary greatly among different countries.\\n\\nThe three fundamental traits of a republic include:\\n1. A republic is a system of government in which \"the people and their elected politicians hold power\" (Latin: res publica, meaning \"public matter\"). In contrast to a monarchy or oligarchy, where power is conferred upon a particular individual or group, a republic is driven by the concept of political liberty and democracy. Voters choose representatives who draft, propose, and pass laws through constitutional processes, and these representatives are accountable to the people.\\n2. In a republic, authority is divided into distinct branches, such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This division is intended to promote equilibrium and prevent excessive concentration of power in the hands of a single individual or group. Separation of powers is a crucial component of this idea, enabling the different branches to serve as checks and balances on one another.\\n3. A republican form of government is structured through a constitution that outlines the system\\'s laws, principles, and procedures.
